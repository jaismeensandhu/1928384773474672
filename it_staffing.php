Mentor also has unique technical recruitment process that has been developed over the past 10 years and proven to be highly effectively to ensure before you see a resume they have gone through multiple levels of screening.</p><p>In other words we do not just search the job websites and fling the resume at the client without any due process which many of our competitors do.   We have an extensive technical screening panel covering a wide variety of Technology Stacks and Applications Software Products.  Mentor also uses the latest testing software products that requires a programmer to write code and that code gets analyzed on multiple levels. Mentor also is also developing a Video Based Screening product that will share such screenings after completion with the client via email prior to deciding if they would like to interview the candidate themselves.</p><p> This has all been put in place to produce a comprehensive system that will ensure the highest quality and project fit for any candidate submitted by Mentor.   We know that your staffâ€™s time is at a premium and we are always look for ways to reduce the time your staff spends on interviewing candidates that were never a fit to begin with.</p>
